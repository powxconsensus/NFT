# NFT

Anyone may create an NFT token by providing it a name and a price; he will then be the owner of that NFT, with the ability to edit, make it for sale or remove it in the future. The highest bidder for that NFT will obtain ownership, and his bidding sum will be handed to the previous owner. The money of someone who has already bid can be withdrawn.
